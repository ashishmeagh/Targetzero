Blind flanges had been removed and vent caps installed, employees were on the roof for an hour after blinds were removed. At some point soon after, diesel fuel began to spill onto the white-capped mod-bit roof, and ran across the roof to a scupper. Diesel fuel ran down the roof leader into a catch basin installed as part of the storm system at the building. Diesel was observed at the downspout and pumps were immediately shut down.

When one of the workers in the scissor lift reached to remove a jack head he inadvertently pushed the beam off the lift. The beam struck one of the employees on the ground, who was a lead. Initially the employees did not report the event, as the employee did not complain of significant pain at the time. On 4/2/2015, the incident was reported and the employee requested an evaluation and went directly to the occupational clinic for an x-ray from home. He was diagnosed with a hairline fracture in the left forearm, given a soft cast, and work restrictions. He is back to work, with restrictions. As a lead he is able to perform his normal duties.

The work to be performed was the installation of foundations for the Mega CUB overhead fuel-oil system piping (staking pt. 607 on civil drawings). An Excavation permit (Utility Locate Sign-Off) was obtained, per process updated 4/7. Because the work was to be done under a work notification (150397), a walk with the Lithko, WT, and the client was completed to visually identify the location of all live utilities around the excavation. The walk included Grady Tindel, and Dan Merin with Whiting-Turner, Stefan Swaggerty with Lithko, and Phillip Johnston with Vandelay. All utilities were confirmed, marked, and signed off on the Utility Locate Sign-Off Sheet. The Dig Permit was then executed by Grady Tindel, and work began. Once the excavation was complete and the footing was poured, Lithko formed and poured the column pedestals on Thursday 4/16/15. On Friday morning 4/17/15 Lithko started to wreck the forms around the northern pedestal. The east side bracing was staked in the first bench with a 24- stake 15- down from existing grade. When the worker pulled the stake out, they smelled and heard gas and reinserted the stake. The line was isolated, and the client and Whiting-Turner were notified. Excavation of the line then began to make the repairs. The damaged section of line was cut out. Two electro-fuse couplings were attached to the existing ends of the gas line with a new section of line between them. Once the fusion and cool down process was complete gas was re-introduced to section of line. A soap test was then performed on the connection points of the couplings. No leaks were observed. The gas line is back in service and has been backfilled upon completion of the pedestals. Additional marking (both painted and vertical) are going to be put in place going forward, along with increased supervision with these activities from Whiting-Turner site crews. ',1,88);

The object struck the employee on the head, the employee was wearing a hard hat. The employee was immediately taken to Mayes County Hospital in Pryor. The employee received staples for a laceration from the impact and was diagnosed with a slight concussion. The employee has been released and is being driven home by a family member. 6/8/15 - Interim Report Employee was hit by a section of pipe and not the P-trap. Pipe section had couplers installed at both ends but were not tightened as the battery powered tool in use had too low a charge to complete the task. Employee descended in his scissor lift to retreve a fresh battery to continue tightening, it was at this time the incident occured. A section of pipe was able to slip out of it´s connection at the drain and strike the employee. The employee remains off work to continue to have medical tests performed due to another medical issue that was discovered during the hospital visit. At this time Apex is considering the injury to be recordable but is not counting the days away as lost time days as the illness is a seperate issue and not work related. A final report will be issued when more details are available. 7/1/15 - Final Report The employee returned to work on 6/11/15 with no restrictions. Employee was unable to wear a hardhat due to the staples he received as a result of the laceration and performed other activities that did not require hard hat use until staples could be removed. To prevent this from occurring in the future Apex Plumbing has began using riser clamps in place of the clevis hangers which allowed the pipe to pivot in this incident. ',307,88);

He has 3rd degree burns on his arms and face. His fiance, her father, and brother as well as his parents are with him. Ben Martinelli, (Whiting-Turner 2F Electrical Contract Manager) will be stopping by the hospital later today to check again on his wellbeing and drop off a card. Additional information regarding the incident: The SPD was locked and tagged however the 52U breaker (separate section of gear directly below the SPD) was not locked and tagged nor was the HVL locked and tagged. The 52U upper panel had been removed and the arc flash occurred in the upper portion of the 52U cabinet. Immediately upon completion of Mike´s transport off site Whiting-Turner secured the area, G4S posted guards, and both the client and Whiting Turner applied locks at the HVL. G4S will stand a guard 24 hours per day until further notice with instructions that absolutely nobody be allowed access to any portion of this line-up. Whiting-Turner Senior Management will be on site on Monday. Interim Report - 7/23/2015 Good Morning, we received the following information from Matt Simcox of PayneCrest a few minutes ago, "I wanted to let you know the positive news about Mike Martinez condition. He was released from the hospital yesterday evening. The treating physician believes he is not a candidate for skin grafting surgery. He is scheduled for a follow-up next Tuesday @ 11:00 AM for wound re-dressing. We are optimistic that he will be back on site as early as mid-next week working in a limited capacity. He would not be available for field work immediately and we have disciplinary action to consider: But for the purposes of this email I would like to keep it all positive." Interim Report - 7/28/2015 From Matt Simcox of PayneCrest Electric: Mike Martinez follow up just concluded. Mostly all positive news. The re-dressing took longer than expected but his wounds are healing very well. He has nearly full use of his left arm (he is left arm dominant). His right arm is still swollen but is recovering well. The doctor re-iterated and confirmed that skin-grafting will not be necessary and there is no nerve damage. The unfortunate news. Because of the residual swelling from the burn healing process compounded by his diabetes he has not been released back to the jobsite. The doctor scheduled a follow up next Friday 08/07. He said at that time he will release Mike back to the job. He is slated to return on Monday 08/10. Final Report - 8/10/2015 Mike Martinez was given a full work release by the treating physician last Friday and he returned to work today with no restrictions.',1,1);
