Worker could not get the torch to ignite so he reached out of the formed box area, grabbed, turned and shook the propane cylinder sideways. The worker was using a cigarette lighter to light the propane torch, turning cylinder on side & shaking cylinder causing a liquid mist to spray through the torch hose/rosebud head. Fire watch co- worker got out of the way at this time. Worker then used his lighter to light the torch that was held in the box-out while he was standing in the box-out.

After the incident Whiting-Turner instructed Contractor Erectors to perform a safety stand down and re-train workers on how to properly light torches. (This was never performed. Workers went back to work after lunch without performance of safety stand down and training.) 2.	Whiting Turner instructed Contractor Erectors to remove all cigarette lighters from workers using torches. 3.	Due to past safety violations, past near misses, past incidents, and lack of stand down/training being performed prior to restarting work, Contractor Erectors have been removed from the job site permanently. 4.	Along with the removal of Contractor Erectors, Gardner Watson is also permanently removed from job site for past failures in safety performance.');
